# SecUDP

SecUDP is a fork of ENet by Lee Salzman with built-in encryption
and server authentication. This is for developers who need only
some basic encryption for things like chats, message authentication,
or other such things, but don't want another dependency to manage 
and/or want to save a couple days incorporating that with ENet.

# TODO

* Learn how to use ENet (*Blush* This is embarrassing...)
* Create light wrapper around ENet hosts and peers with
  other things like secret keys and the like.
