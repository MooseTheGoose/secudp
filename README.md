# secudp

secudp is a fork of ENet which aims to build
in encryption and server authentication on 
top of ENet's protocol. This is useful for keeping
things like chats, status updates, and the like
secret without having to look for another dependency
or spending a bit of time incorporating encryption
into the protocol. The best part is that this is
completely transparent except for some instantiation
details.

# TODO

* Read up on ENet source code enough to find out how
  to incorporate encryption seamlessly into the protocol

* Update licenses so that it adequately gives credit to
  Lee Salzmann for providing an amazing starting point.
